GrandPlan
____________________________

This is a simple planner app created for Android. 

It has the ability to go to any week from 2019 to 2030 and load the events for the week. The user can also modify the week and add/remove events that have a title and description to any hour of the week. Whenever the user would like to go back to the current day, they can do so by pressing "TODAY". All the functions of a simple paper-based planner.

Something to note about this app: the core functionality of it is procressed in a C++ library and only the interface is controlled by Java code. This was where I first practiced my C++ to create a calandar library that keeps track of date and time.

But, all-in-all, this is a simple android app, created as a planner. Feel free to take a look at the source. Although, there is no version control. Since the andriod development environment is so complicated to set up, I chose to keep only one, overwritten, source repository, to make things easier. I would have included a runnable build, but android development isn't a cake walk, you need an emulator to use the app ON android. So, honestly, I don't think it's worth the trouble. What is, is a collection of screenshots of the app; they provide a suffiecient experience of the finished project and paint a nice picture of it. Anyways, enjoy browsing.

And, if you're having trouble sifting through the directories, this might help:
Source: Source/app/src/main

Also, feel free to take a look at the precursor application of GrandPlan, "GrandPlanJavaFX"
